# Janet (Generic Netcode)

This project aims to create a platform for games based on live-feed sessions, for example four-in-a-row.

## First thoughts

- Web sockets - live updates
- sqlite storage - not meant for large scale usage
- webapi - games are written separately, example game may be included for concept developement and testing, probably four-in-a-row
