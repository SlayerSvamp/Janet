# Janet (Generic Netcode)

This project aims to create a platform for games based on live-feed sessions, for example four-in-a-row.

## First thoughts

- Web sockets - live updates
- sqlite storage - not meant for large scale usage
- webapi - games are written separately, example game may be included for concept developement and testing, probably four-in-a-row

## Backlog

- Security?
- Admin page?
- login or just local cookies? How do you determine if a session is "dead"?
- spectator mode?
- unique names? ( game? session? player? )
